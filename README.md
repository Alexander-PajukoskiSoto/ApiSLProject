# Description:

This is a purely front-end application that fetches data from different APIs and displays them on the screen. The content that is shown or is supposed to show (some APIs have stopped working) is.: Book top-sellers, the weather in Huddinge and busses and train-departures from Huddinge on page one. On the second page shows my schedule from the day, fotten from Google Calendar API.

# Why:

This project was given to me as a task from my teacher at NTI Gymnasiet fourth year of IT to practice fetching, and showing data from APIs.

# How to use:

The indexpage will have 2 links, one to page1 and one to page2. To see page one, you can open up the indexfile
